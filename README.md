As part of my master's program, I participated in a data science competition on the DrivenData platform. The goal of the project was to develop a machine learning model that predicts the status of water pumps (functional, non-functional, or in need of repair) using a dataset with approximately 50 features, including both numerical and categorical variables.

The dataset presented several real-world challenges, such as missing data and high-cardinality categorical variables, which required careful preprocessing and feature engineering. Additionally, the target variable was imbalanced, meaning the distribution of the pump statuses was not uniform, making it necessary to apply techniques to address this imbalance in the training process.

The project involved the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning missing values and encoding categorical variables with high cardinality.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features from the existing dataset to improve model performance.

Model Selection: Testing different machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to identify the best-performing model.

Evaluation and Submission: The model's performance was evaluated based on its accuracy in predicting the pump statuses. I submitted the predictions to the competition platform, which provided a leaderboard ranking based on the accuracy score.
This project allowed me to apply a full machine learning workflow, from data cleaning and feature engineering to model selection and evaluation, while working with real-world data issues. The code and detailed explanation of the process can be found in my GitHub repository
